# Styledpixel's Portfolio

A personal portfolio to provide details of, and showcase my skills.

# To-Do List

* [ ] Finish coding the portfolio ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
* [ ] Optimise **everything** - need to minify etc
* [x] Switch to elixir & sass (shouldn't have added the folders to the main project, forgot to .gitignore)

## Front-End Built With

* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Creative Tim's Navbar](http://www.creative-tim.com/product/navbar-with-icons)
* Pixiden's [7 Stroke](http://themes-pixeden.com/font-demos/7-stroke/)
